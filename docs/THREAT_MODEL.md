# Threat Model (session 4, 2026-10-18)

Scope: the current code (CLI + SQLite + deterministic demo runners). Adapters that run real agents, an HTTP API and a UI do **not exist yet**; their threats are listed as *future* and must be re-assessed (see D-010). "Mitigated" means a test or an executed probe exists (see TEST_EVIDENCE.md); it does not mean "proven secure". No independent security review has been done.

## Assets
- Integrity of regression verdicts (a false pass is the worst failure, per D-003).
- The user's machine (no code from case files/traces may run on it).
- Stored runs in the SQLite file (may contain whatever the agent output, including secrets or personal data).
- Availability of the CLI (no hangs/crashes from hostile input).

## Trust boundaries (all of these are untrusted data)
1. Case JSON files given to `case add`.
2. Agent/runner output (today only demo runners; later real agents).
3. Contents of an existing SQLite file passed via `--db`.
4. Strings echoed into reports (case ids, paths, expected/actual values).

Trusted: the person running the CLI (they choose file paths, `--db`, `--output`).

## Threats and status

| # | Threat | Status | Mitigation / evidence | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Oversized, malformed, deeply nested, or non-UTF-8 case file | Mitigated | 1,000,000-byte read cap, JSON-only parse, typed models with `extra=forbid`, 100-assertion cap; hostile probes exit 2 cleanly (TEST_EVIDENCE s2 #9) | No limit on path length or on `input`/`expected` nesting beyond Python's recursion limit (which is caught) |
| 2 | Code execution through a case/trace | Mitigated by construction | No `eval`/`exec`/`subprocess`/`pickle`/dynamic import in `src/` (grep, session 4); case data is only parsed as JSON | Any future adapter breaks this assumption: D-010 |
| 3 | ReDoS via `regex` assertions | Partially mitigated | Static validation + 200-char / 5,000-char caps (D-009); fuzz: slowest accepted 0.73-0.81 s, no 30 s timeouts | Estimate, not proof; no hard timeout possible in-process; worst case per assertion is about 1 s x up to 100 assertions per case |
| 4 | Report/Markdown injection (pipes, newlines, HTML, huge values) | Mitigated for Markdown/JSON | Values length-limited, whitespace-collapsed, HTML-entity escaped; golden-file + injection tests | HTML reports do not exist; if added, re-assess |
| 5 | SQL injection | Mitigated | All user data bound as parameters; the only f-strings in SQL interpolate internal constants; injection-like ids tested | None known |
| 6 | Corrupt or newer-schema database | Mitigated | Clear exit 2 (no traceback); newer or negative schema version refused; versioned atomic migrations; real v1->v2 upgrade tested (session 7); tampered metadata columns give a clean `StorageError` | Large databases and concurrent migration untested |
| 7 | Runner output too large to store | Mitigated (session 4) | Recorded as a failed run with an explanatory error instead of crashing/losing the run (test added) | Runner CPU/memory use is not limited (demo runners only) |
| 8 | Secrets / personal data in stored outputs | **Not mitigated** | None | No redaction; DB is plaintext, created in the working directory with default permissions. Do not run real agents with sensitive data yet |
| 9 | Path abuse via `--output` / `case add FILE` | Partially mitigated | `report --output` refuses to overwrite without `--force`; read errors are clean exit 2 | `--force` follows symlinks; reading a FIFO/special file path is untested and could block. Acceptable only because the user chooses the paths |
| 10 | Concurrent access to one SQLite file | Not verified | SQLite's own locking | Not tested |
| 11 | Supply chain | Partial | One runtime dependency (`pydantic>=2.6,<3`); CI uses pinned major versions of actions | No lock file, no hash pinning, actions not pinned by SHA; regex analysis relies on private `re._parser` (fails closed if missing) |
| 12 | Flaky/nondeterministic agents hiding as passes | Partially mitigated | `run --repeat` and `run-all --repeat` report `stable` | Only meaningful with a real nondeterministic agent (none exists yet) |
| 13 | Terminal noise: `BrokenPipeError` traceback when output is piped into `head` | Known, cosmetic | Observed in session 3 | Not fixed |

## Future threats (not yet applicable)
- Adapters executing user commands/code or calling HTTP endpoints (sandbox escape, resource exhaustion, SSRF, env/secret leakage, output injection). Required before any such adapter: the isolation design in D-010.
- HTTP API: authentication, CSRF, local-only bind, request size limits.
- Trace import: untrusted large/nested files; prompt-injection text inside traces is data and must never be executed or fed to tools.
